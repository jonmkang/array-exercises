2. Explore the push() method
    when only one value is pushed:
        The length is 1, capacity is 3, and the memory address is 0.

    When 6 values are pushed:
        The length is 6, capacity is 12, and the memory address is 3.
        When the length is greater than the capacity, the capacity increases by the current length multiplied by three which is 4 * 3.  The pointer is then increased by the current size of the array which is 3.

3. Exploring the pop() method

    When 3 values are pop'd:
        The length is 3, capacity is 12, and the memory address is 3.
        The capacity of the array stays the same, but the last 3 values are removed.

4. Understanding more about how arrays work
    The printed item of the value 'tauhida' results in NaN.
    My guess would be the array has initialized a slot for an integer and did not recognize a string in place of an integer and stored NaN instead.

    _resize() reassigns the array to a new pointer where a larger size is allocated for the array.
